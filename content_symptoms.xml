\n\nDiagnosis \n  - The symptoms characteristic of the Zika virus are similar to those of dengue (breakbone fever) and chikungunya, diseases spread through the same mosquitoes that transmit Zika
\n\n  - See your healthcare provider if you develop the symptoms described above and have visited an area where Zika is found
\n\n  - If you have recently traveled, tell your healthcare provider when and where you traveled, as this information is relevant to them
\n\n  - Your healthcare provider may order blood tests to look for not only Zika but other similar viruses such as dengue or chikungunya
\n\n  - Zika virus disease diagnostics is primarily based on detection of viral RNA from clinical specimens in acutely ill patients
\n\n\nTreatment \nCurrently there are no vaccine for Zika virus

\n\nHowever, what you can do if you contract the virus is:
\n\n  - Get plenty of rest
\n\n  - Drink fluids to prevent dehydration
\n\n  - Take medicine such as acetaminophen (TylenolÂ®) or paracetamol to reduce fever and pain
\n\n  - Do not take aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) until dengue has be ruled out to reduce the risk of internal bleeding
\n\n  - If you are taking medicine for another medical condition, talk to your healthcare provider before taking additional medication
\n\nIf you are diagnosed with the virus, prevent mosquito bites for the first week of your illness as this may spread the virus locally. During the first week of infection, Zika virus can be found in the blood and passed from an infected person to a mosquito through mosquito bites. Furthermore, an infected mosquito can then spread the virus to other people
